# Importing Public Keys

* This short chapter reviews how to import keys to a GPG keyring
	* As stated previously, software adhering to the OpenPGP standard requires users to import the public keys of their intended recipients to their keyring to run commands like encryption and verifying signatures	

## Importing Keys

* When another user shares their public key with you, first import it by running the `gpg --import` command, passing the absolute/relative path of the key you mean to import as a parameter
	* In this example, we use PGP sample keys provided by IETF[^1]

```console
foo@bar:~$ gpg â€“-import alice.gpg
gpg: key F231550C4F47E38E: public key "Alice Lovelace <alice@openpgp.example>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```
<br />

* List out the public keys in your keyring to verify that the key was successfully imported

```console
foo@bar:~$ gpg --list-keys
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
