# GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) Beginner Guide

This reference guide is to help new users of the *GNU Privacy Guard* (GPG or GnuP)[^1] command line tool. Its originally intended audience was the students and teaching assistants of Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer and Information Science's CY2550 course[^2], AKA Foundations of Cybersecurity. It therefore follows the structures and recommendations of the course.

I want to emphasize that I am not a cryptography or GPG expert, and the information provided here is based on my personal experiences and research.

It is essential to be aware of the legal implications of using encryption tools like GPG in your jurisdiction. Ensure that your usage complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

GPG is a part of the open source software community, and its development is a collaborative effort by many individuals and organizations. For official documentation, updates, and support, please refer to the official GPG website.
